# Redirect Implementation Plan: Setting Default Route to Login Page

## Current Structure
- The login page is implemented in `sqlprime-app/src/app/auth/page.tsx`
- The root page is currently a default Next.js landing page in `sqlprime-app/src/app/page.tsx`

## Implementation Approach

We'll use Next.js's built-in redirect functionality in the root page component. This is a clean approach that:
1. Maintains the separation of concerns (auth pages stay in the auth directory)
2. Follows Next.js conventions
3. Is SEO-friendly with proper HTTP redirects
4. Requires minimal code changes

### Detailed Steps

1. Modify the root `page.tsx` file to implement a redirect to the `/auth` route
2. Use Next.js's redirect function from the `next/navigation` package
3. Keep the auth page implementation as is

## Routing Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User visits /] --> B[Root page.tsx]
    B -->|Redirect| C[/auth route]
    C --> D[Auth page.tsx]
    D --> E[Login UI]
```

## Code Implementation

Replace the content of `sqlprime-app/src/app/page.tsx` with:

```tsx
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default function Home() {
  redirect('/auth');
}
```

This server component will automatically redirect users from the root path to the login page at `/auth`.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clean Separation**: Keeps authentication logic in the auth directory
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify or remove the redirect if requirements change
3. **Performance**: Server-side redirect happens before any client-side rendering
4. **SEO**: Proper HTTP redirect status code for search engines

## Alternative Approaches (Not Recommended)

1. **Moving Login Page to Root**: Could move login page content to root page.tsx, but this would mix concerns and make the codebase less organized.

2. **Middleware Redirect**: Could implement a Next.js middleware to redirect from root to auth, but this would be more complex for a simple redirect case.

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement the changes
2. Test the redirect functionality
3. Verify that users are properly redirected to the login page when accessing the root URL
