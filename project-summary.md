# SQLPrime Project Overview

## Project Concept
SQLPrime is a web application for SQL query optimization that helps developers analyze and improve database query performance. The application analyzes execution plans, identifies bottlenecks, and provides actionable recommendations to enhance query efficiency.

## Core Value Proposition
- Provides intelligent analysis of SQL queries to identify performance bottlenecks
- Offers actionable recommendations for query optimization and indexing
- Visualizes execution plans for better understanding of query performance
- Uses AI to enhance recommendations beyond rule-based approaches

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: C# .NET 7+, ASP.NET Core Web API, Dapper
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Monaco Editor, D3.js
- **Database**: SQL Server (initially, with plans to add MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for enhanced recommendations

## Project Structure
- **Solution**: `SQLPrime.sln`
- **Core Projects**:
  - `SQLPrime.Api` - Web API
  - `SQLPrime.Core` - Domain entities and business logic
  - `SQLPrime.Application` - Application services
  - `SQLPrime.Infrastructure` - Data access and external services

## Development Roadmap

### MVP (Phase 1: 4 weeks)
- Basic authentication
- Connection management for SQL Server
- Query input with syntax highlighting
- Basic execution plan retrieval and display
- Simple rule-based recommendations

### Phase 2 (6 weeks)
- Interactive execution plan visualization
- Advanced query analysis
- Query history and management
- Enhanced recommendations

### Phase 3 (4 weeks)
- OpenAI integration for AI-enhanced recommendations
- Performance prediction
- Before/after comparison

### Phase 4 (3 weeks)
- Support for PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Database-specific optimizations

### Phase 5 (5 weeks)
- Natural language interface
- Workload analysis
- Performance monitoring

### Phase 6 (4 weeks)
- Team collaboration
- Reporting and exports
- API for external integration

## Monetization Strategy
- **Free Tier**: Basic analysis, limited connections
- **Developer Tier** ($20/month): Advanced analysis, unlimited connections
- **Professional Tier** ($50/month): Multiple database support, workload analysis
- **Enterprise Tier** ($200+/month): Team features, API access

## Key AI Integration Points
1. Query pattern recognition and rewriting
2. Execution plan analysis for implicit bottlenecks
3. Performance impact prediction
4. Index recommendation balancing read/write performance
5. Natural language query interface

## Initial UI Wireframe
The wireframe demonstrates:
- Navigation and user interface layout
- Connection management panel
- SQL editor with Monaco interface
- Execution plan visualization
- Performance metrics and recommendations

## Next Steps
1. Set up project architecture and repositories
2. Implement basic backend services for connection management
3. Create frontend with query editor and basic analysis
4. Develop rule-based recommendations engine
5. Build execution plan visualization component
